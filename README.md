# QCL

It is a Python program with generated OpenCL for Lattice QCD (for arbitrary lattice dimensions, arbitrary volume, arbitrary SU(n) gauge group, and arbitrary actions (as long as the action can be described in terms of paths).

## Example Algorithms

- plaquette
- loops (Wilson, Polyakov)
- heatbath (Wilson, Improved, Unisotropic)
- fermi operators (D shash, smearings)
- D slash for Wilson (+Clover) and KS fermions (Asqtad, HISQ) 
- Inverters (minres, bicgstab)
- meson, baryon, hadron operators of contraction
